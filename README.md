## An example of Browserify not recognizing a module bundled with Browserify.

I am trying to see how to package up node modules in a bundle separate from my own bundle, but cannot understand why it will not work.

To try it out :

     npm run brfy
     
To clean back to original state

     npm run clean-all

To see the problem, open the file  `public/index.html`  in a browser, and check the console.

Also look at `public/common.js`  and `public/boop.js`.
